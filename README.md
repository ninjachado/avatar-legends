# avatar-legends

This is the full HTML, CSS, and Translation code for an Avatar Legends character sheet in Roll20. 
It is a fully working character sheet with roll buttons and move references. A one stop shop for Avatar Legends gaming via Roll20. 

This sheet is a heavily modified Monster of the Week sheet from Evil Hat Games. 
I didn't invent any of this code, merely adapted and used it to create this resource.
This sheet currently only has support the 6 playbooks in the Quickstart Guide,
but it does have support for "Custom" playbooks and moves so that you can add other playbooks that you need.
